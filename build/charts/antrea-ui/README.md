## Values

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| affinity | object | `{}` | Affinity for the Antrea UI Pod. |
| backend.image | object | `{"pullPolicy":"IfNotPresent","repository":"antrea/antrea-ui-backend","tag":""}` | Container image to use for the Antrea UI backend. |
| backend.port | int | `8080` | Container port on which the backend will listen/ |
| backend.resources | object | `{}` | Resource requests and limits for the backend container. |
| frontend.image | object | `{"pullPolicy":"IfNotPresent","repository":"antrea/antrea-ui-frontend","tag":""}` | Container image to use for the Antrea UI frontend. |
| frontend.port | int | `3000` | Container port on which the frontend will listen. |
| frontend.resources | object | `{}` | Resource requests and limits for the frontend container. |
| https.auto | object | `{"commonName":"localhost","daysValid":365,"dnsNames":[],"ipAddresses":[]}` | Configure automatic TLS certificate generation with Helm. |
| https.auto.commonName | string | `"localhost"` | Common name to use in the certificate. |
| https.auto.daysValid | int | `365` | Number of days for which the certificate will be valid. There is no automatic rotation with this method. |
| https.auto.dnsNames | list | `[]` | DNS names to use in the certificate. |
| https.auto.ipAddresses | list | `[]` | IP addresses to use in the certificate. |
| https.enable | bool | `false` | Enable HTTPS (only) for accessing the web UI. |
| https.method | string | `"auto"` | Method for generating the TLS certificate for the web server. We support "auto", "user", "userCA", and "secret". With "auto", Helm will generate a new self-signed certificate every time the template function is executed. With "user", the user is responsible for providing a certificate and key, which will be used directly. With "userCA", the user is responsible for providing a CA certificate and key, which will be used to generate a signed certificate to be used by the web server. With "secret", the user is responsible for providing a secret of type kubernetes.io/tls, in the Namespace of the release. The secret must include the tls.crt and tls.key data fields. |
| https.secret.secretName | string | `"antrea-ui-tls"` | Name of the secret containing the PEM data for the certificate and private key to use. Secret must be of type kubernetes.io/tls. The typical use case is a secret generated by cert-manager. The secret must exist in the Namespace of the Helm release (typically, kube-system). |
| https.user | object | `{"cert":"","key":""}` | Use the provided TLS certificate and key. |
| https.user.cert | string | `""` | Certificate (base64-encoded PEM format) |
| https.user.key | string | `""` | Private key (base64-encoded PEM format) |
| https.userCA | object | `{"cert":"","commonName":"localhost","daysValid":365,"dnsNames":[],"ipAddresses":[],"key":""}` | Use the provided CA certificate and key to generate a signed certificate. |
| https.userCA.cert | string | `""` | CA certificate (base64-encoded PEM format) |
| https.userCA.commonName | string | `"localhost"` | Common name to use in the certificate. |
| https.userCA.daysValid | int | `365` | Number of days for which the certificate will be valid. There is no automatic rotation with this method. |
| https.userCA.dnsNames | list | `[]` | DNS names to use in the certificate. |
| https.userCA.ipAddresses | list | `[]` | IP addresses to use in the certificate. |
| https.userCA.key | string | `""` | CA private key (base64-encoded PEM format) |
| ipv6.enable | bool | `true` | Enable IPv6 for accessing the web UI. Even if the cluster does not support IPv6, you do not typically need to set this value to false. |
| nodeSelector | object | `{"kubernetes.io/os":"linux"}` | Node selector for the Antrea UI Pod. |
| podAnnotations | object | `{}` | Annotations to be added to the Antrea UI Pod. |
| podLabels | object | `{}` | Labels to be added to the Antrea UI Pod. |
| service.annotations | object | `{}` | Annotations to be added to the Service. |
| service.externalTrafficPolicy | string | `nil` | Override the ExternalTrafficPolicy for the Service. Set it to Local to route Service traffic to Node-local endpoints only. |
| service.labels | object | `{}` | Labels to be added to the Service. |
| service.nodePort | int | `31234` | - The Node port to use when the Service type is NodePort or LoadBalancer. |
| service.port | int | `3000` | The port on which the Service is exposed. |
| service.type | string | `"ClusterIP"` | - The type of Service used for Antrea UI access, either ClusterIP, NodePort or LoadBalancer. |
| tolerations | object | `{}` | Tolerations for the Antrea UI Pod. |
