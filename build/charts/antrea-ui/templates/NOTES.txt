The Antrea UI has been successfully installed

You are using version {{ .Chart.Version }}

{{- $port := 3000 -}}
{{- $scheme := "http" -}}
{{- if .Values.https.enable }}
{{- $scheme = "https" }}
{{- end }}

To access the UI, forward a local port to the antrea-ui service, and connect to that port locally
with your browser:

  $ kubectl -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} port-forward service/antrea-ui {{ $port }}:{{ .Values.service.port }}

After running the command above, access "{{ $scheme }}://localhost:{{ $port }}" in your browser.

{{- if and .Values.https.enable (eq .Values.https.method "auto") }}

HTTPS is enabled to access the UI and a self-signed certificate was automatically generated. You can
access the certificate with the following command:

  $ kubectl -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} get secret/antrea-ui-tls-helm  -o jsonpath='{.data.tls\.crt}' | base64 --decode

{{- end }}

{{- if and (not .Values.https.enable) (not (kindIs "bool" .Values.security.cookieSecure)) }}

HTTPS is disabled. If you are using Ingress to expose the UI and you are terminating TLS at Ingress,
we recommend that you set security.cookieSecure to true.
