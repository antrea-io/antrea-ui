{{- $port := 3000 -}}
{{- $scheme := "http" -}}
{{- if .Values.https.enable }}
{{- $scheme = "https" }}

To access the UI, forward a local port to the antrea-ui service, and connect to
that port locally with your browser:

  $ kubectl -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} port-forward service/antrea-ui {{ $port }}:{{ .Values.service.port }}

After running the command above, access "{{ $scheme }}://localhost:{{ $port }}" in your browser.

{{- if and .Values.https.enable (eq .Values.https.method "auto") }}

HTTPS is enabled to access the UI and a self-signed certificate was
automatically generated. You can access the certificate with the following
command:

  $ kubectl -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} get secret/antrea-ui-tls-cert  -o jsonpath='{.data.cert\.pem}' | base64 --decode

{{ end -}}
